        "The term **Life Expectancy** refers to the number of years a person can expect to live. It is based on an estimate of the average age of a population when they die. Life expectancy is one of the key metrics used for assessing the overall health of a population.\n",
        "\n",
        " The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under the World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries. It has been observed that in the past 15 years, there is a huge development in the health sector resulting in the improvement of human mortality rates. The increases are nearly universal, from the richest to the poorest countries. Let's dive deeper into the life expectancy dataset and find out how different factors influence your life expectancy.\n",
